# NLP
LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) is a smart math trick using something called SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). In simple words:

It turns all your text into numbers.

It finds patterns in those numbers.

It shows you hidden topics based on the most important patterns.

Let’s Understand the Topics:
🔹 Topic 1: mouse | house | fox | box | ham | eggs | green | eat | sam | like
This looks like it's from “Green Eggs and Ham” and “Fox in Socks.”
👉 Topic theme: Characters and food in funny rhymes

🔹 Topic 2: chicks | say | sews | sue | mr | box | fox | sir | socks | knox
These are all about tongue-twisters and characters from “Fox in Socks.”
👉 Topic theme: Rhyming and silly word play

🔹 Topic 3: know | mother | did | oh | look | things | fish | hat | said | cat
This has all the words from “The Cat in the Hat.”
👉 Topic theme: A chaotic visit from the Cat

🔹 Topic 4: shame | knox | ham | green | eggs | try | sam | like | mr | sir
More from “Green Eggs and Ham” — maybe the turning point when the character tries the food.
👉 Topic theme: Reluctance and change of heart

🔹 Topic 5: rain | let | dark | tree | train | say | mr | car | sir | eat
These words are also from “Green Eggs and Ham”, where the character is asked to eat in different places.
👉 Topic theme: Funny places and situations
